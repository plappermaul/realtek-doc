This repository serves as a well selected collection of Realtek switch SoC documentation and source. Focus is on the Otto platform with the RTL838x (maple), RTL839x (cypress), RTL930x (longan) and RTL931x (mango) chips. Additional infos can be found at https://svanheule.net/switches/start

What RTK (development kit) we have

- The most recent SDK from 2022 is based on the D-Link DMS-1250 GPL source. It contains a lot of PHY code for RTL8224, RTL8261 and RTL8264. Download from https://tsd.dlink.com.tw/GPL.asp
- An older SDK from 2016 is based on the Zyxel XGS1210-12 GPL source. It contains some totaly unknown PHY code for RTL8284. Download can be requested from https://www.zyxel.com/global/en/form/gpl-oss-software-notice
